Sites like [slashdot](http://slashdot.org "slashdot") post articles for users 
to comment on. On a regular basis someone posts as soon as they can, just so 
they can claim the position of first post. But I’m above all that. I won’t 
sully such sites with my one-upmanship – I’ll do it on my own blog! So there. 

First!
