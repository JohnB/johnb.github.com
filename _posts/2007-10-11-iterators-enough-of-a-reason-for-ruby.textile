A non-programmer friend recently asked me why I liked Ruby so much. I asked 
him for a simple task that I could write in Ruby and we came up with a pyramid 
– from a single “a” to 26 “z”s. So I showed him this one-liner:

`"a".upto("z") { |c| puts c * (1 + c[0] - "a"[0]) }`

And then showed him the same program in C:

	#include "stdio.h"
	int main( int argc, char **argv )
	{
	  int loop = 0;
	  for( loop = 0; loop < 26; loop++ )
	  {
	    int innerloop = 0;
	    for( innerloop = 0; innerloop <= loop; innerloop++ )
	    {
	      printf( "%c", 'a' + loop );
	    }
	    printf("n");
	  }
	  return 0;
	}

Enough said.

_2/6/2008 Update: _it might be shorter and more clear like this

`("a".."z").each_with_index { |c,i| puts (c * (i + 1)) }`
