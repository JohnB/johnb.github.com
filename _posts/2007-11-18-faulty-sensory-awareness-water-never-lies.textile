			<p>I’m learning how to use my body, with the help of <a href="http://amiraalvarez.com/">Amira</a>, my Alexander teacher.  The <a href="http://www.alexandertech.org/">Alexander Technique</a> has a number of techniques for reminding us that (a) we are usually working harder than we need to and (b) what we <em>think</em> we are doing is not always what we are <em>actually</em> doing.  This latter aspect is known as “Faulty Sensory Awareness” because, although we may think we are standing up straight, any observer (or ourself looking in a mirror) can tell that we’re leaning one way or the other.</p>
<p>This became very clear to me last week as I was swimming laps.  When kicking a length on my back, I tend to believe I’m looking straight up at the sky.  Although I don’t really need my goggles in this position I usually have them on anyway – I can see the beautiful sky better.  A side benefit of wearing the goggles is that, if I splash, I don’t get water in my eye.  Last week I happened to be kicking on my back with my goggles <em>off</em> and noticed that my left eye was getting a bit of water in it, while my right eye was dry.  Just to verify, I made sure that it happened in both directions down the lane – that it wasn’t due to my neighbor’s wake in the next lane.  Nope.  Unless the pool was tilted, it was me.</p>
<p>Although I thought my nose was pointed straight up, and it certainly felt “normal”, the water was telling me that I was ever so slightly tilted to the left!</p>
<p>So, if you’ve ever wondered about whether your body could work better than it does, give <a href="http://www.alexandertech.org/teachers/CA.html#2501">Amira</a> (<a href="http://www.alexandertech.org/teachers/FindTeachers.php">or any Alexander teacher</a>) a try.  As I always say: “She hasn’t killed me yet!”.  (BTW: that is an inside joke with Amira – she wouldn’t allow that quote on her website so I had to come up with <a href="http://amiraalvarez.com/lessons_endorsements.html">a different one</a>)</p>
