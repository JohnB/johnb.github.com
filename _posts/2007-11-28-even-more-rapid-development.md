title: Even More Rapid Development
---
# {{ page.title }}
<p>The success of the Ruby on Rails web framework is somewhat based on its  ability to soothe the pain caused by the not-so-rapid development process of other, so-called “enterprise-ready” frameworks.  But Rails is not the only Ruby web framework, and not the fastest one for initial prototyping(*).  The faster (more rabid?) ones I’ve looked at:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://camping.rubyforge.org/">Camping</a>.  From the the <a href="http://www.poignantguide.net/ruby/">quirky mind</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">why-the-luck-stiff</a> (no other name given) it inspires absurdly fast development (and absurdity!).</li>
<li>
<a href="http://sinatra.rubyforge.org/">Sinatra</a>.  Some people who have tried Camping have moved on to Sinatra – it has a clean syntax and a simple metaphor (Sinatra attends events) and is supported by a larger team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Its hard to imagine what faster development would look like – maybe a web interface for defining Camping or Sinatra event handlers?  Code the app directly from the browser!</p>
<p>(*) Footnote: Note that I use the word “prototype” because that is all I have done with them – I see no reason they couldn’t scale as well as Rails or any other web framework.</p>
