The success of the Ruby on Rails web framework is somewhat based on its  ability 
to soothe the pain caused by the not-so-rapid development process of other, 
so-called “enterprise-ready” frameworks.  But Rails is not the only Ruby web 
framework, and not the fastest one for initial prototyping(*).  The faster 
(more rabid?) ones I’ve looked at:

- [Camping](http://camping.rubyforge.org/).  From the the [quirky mind](http://www.poignantguide.net/ruby/) of [why-the-luck-stiff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff) (no other name given) it inspires absurdly fast development (and absurdity!).
- [Sinatra](http://sinatra.rubyforge.org/).  Some people who have tried Camping have moved on to Sinatra – it has a clean syntax and a simple metaphor (Sinatra attends events) and is supported by a larger team.

Its hard to imagine what faster development would look like – maybe a web interface 
for defining Camping or Sinatra event handlers?  Code the app directly from 
the browser!

(*) Footnote: Note that I use the word “prototype” because that is all I have 
done with them – I see no reason they couldn’t scale as well as Rails or any 
other web framework.
