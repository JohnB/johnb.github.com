			<p>I was playing <a href="http://www.blokus.com/" title="Official Blokus site">Blokus</a> today, where competition is driven by the scarcity of space on the game board, and realized that the <em>perception</em> of scarcity is often more prevalent than <em>actual</em> scarcity – and thus we needlessly hobble ourselves by limiting things that are abundant.  Similarly, our fear that something might happen to us (crime, identity theft, terrorism, etc. – whatever monsters we see on the evening news) forces us to add locks and protections that mostly just result in making it hard for <em>us</em> to access our <em>own</em> belongings and data and websites.</p>
<p>The context for this discussion is a website (nameless, sorry) that I’m interested in working on.  The startup site, yet another type of social network, holds the promise of allowing for some very interesting and powerful interactions – but unnecessarily limits its users as it guards scarce server resources and data security.  Furthermore, and I’m going out on a limb here, I suspect that these mis-perceptions are one of the reasons  this startup has had difficulty in raising much-needed funds.  Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users are automatically logged out after a few idle minutes, with no option of changing the time period before auto-logout (or choosing “Keep me logged in” for single-user computers).  This seems a bit draconian given that there is nothing accessible on the site that couldn’t be gathered in other ways – no bank statements, social security number or mother’s maiden name.</li>
<li>A PDF document containing the public profile data for your social circle can be generated for off-line access, but only by a subset of the social circle and only for a short period of time.  I think this is intended both for security and to guard scarce resources (such as server time and bandwidth).  The former concern is misguided – anyone receiving the PDF can circumvent security by immediately sending it to bad people – which is unstoppable once you provide off-line access).  The scarcity of server time or bandwidth can be overcome by delegating it to someone else such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2?ie=UTF8&amp;node=201590011&amp;no=3435361&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA" title="Elastic Compute Cloud">Amazon’s ECC</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/S3-AWS-home-page-Money/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16427261&amp;no=3435361&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA" title="Simple Storage Service">S3 services</a>.</li>
<li>New people can be invited to the social circle, but only by a small initial set of users – and those invitations expire relatively quickly.  Its unclear why this decision was made, but I suspect it was due to some perception of scarcity or security.  All it appears to do is add yet another unnecessary barrier to entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>In spite of these issues, and others, I’m still captivated by the underlying ideas that it represents and by what it could become in the future. Hopefully I can <a href="http://www.johnbaylor.org/2007/11/28/even-more-rapid-development/">rapidly prototype</a> my vision for an improved site and use it as a starting point to land a dream job.</p>
