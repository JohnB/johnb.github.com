I’ve just noticed the [geekily](http://xkcd.com/249/ "Yes, I play blindfold 
chess; it says so on my resume") [hilarious](http://xkcd.com/234/ "You see, 
when unix gets confused by spaces, you can tell it to ignore the space by ") 
[xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/ "Click the link, dummy!") and one of the funniest 
aspects is that each comic has a ‘title’ attribute (the text that pops up when 
you hover your mouse over the image) that is often as funny as the comic itself. 
However, the length of the title often causes it to be truncated in my browser 
(Firefox 2.x, which probably has an obscure show-entire-title setting). Rather 
than arduously do a ‘view source’ on each one (or figure out the Firefox setting), 
I have Ruby do it for me. And for _you_ if you want:

	
	# xkcd.rb
	# extract all the titles from xkcd comics since they
	# tend to be too long to fully show in the browser
	
	# USAGE: ruby -rubygems -rxkcd.rb -e 'Xkcd.new.show_all'
	
	require 'open-uri'
	require 'hpricot'
	
	class Xkcd
	  DOMAIN = 'http://xkcd.com/'
	
	  def show id = 343  # 343 is the NSA/RSA one
	    begin
	      @hp = Hpricot.parse( open( "%s/%d/" % [DOMAIN,id.to_i] ) )
	      (@hp / :img).each do |el|
	        puts "%4d: %s" % [id.to_i, el[:title]] if el[:title]
	      end
	    rescue
	    end
	  end
	
	  def show_all
	    0.upto(400) do |i|
	      show i
	    end
	  end
	end

While coding Ruby is surely more fun, you can download the Long Titles add-on for Firefox to fix the problem: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1715/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1715/)

Gee, I hadn’t noticed the title attribute on xkcd. Thanks, John. And thanks Rocky for the firefox addon. Hmmmm, ruby. maybe later.
