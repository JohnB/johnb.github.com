I’ve heard that dual-booting Ubuntu linux was easy but its really true. I’m 
now running Ubuntu and it was as easy as various blog posts have said. The 
longest step in the process was defragmenting the drive before repartitioning 
with Ubuntu. There are a few issues remaining around using the data on the 
Windows partition from Linux, but on the whole I’m very happy with the switch. 

_[Update 1/29/2008: the network is inconsistent.  Upon a boot or un-hibernate 
it may be completely incapable of finding my router - but then later it is 
fine. I'll continue trying to track it down... using the Windows OS!] _
