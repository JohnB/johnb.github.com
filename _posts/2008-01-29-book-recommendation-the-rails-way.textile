			<p><a title="Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Rails-Way-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Ruby/dp/0321445619">The Rails Way</a> is a Ruby on Rails reference book that I bought on <a href="http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/2007/12/20/book-review-the-rails-way">Josh Susser’s recommendation</a>.  I’ve actually, to my family’s dismay, been <em>reading</em> the darn thing instead of just <em>referring</em> to it like one would a, well, reference book.  A lot of Rails’isms that I had a vague idea about I now understand with much more clarity.  It will definitely come in handy soon.</p>
