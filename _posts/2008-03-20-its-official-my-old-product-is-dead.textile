**Pay By Touch To Shut Down All Biometric Services Immediately **

_Biometric authentication transactions to cease at 11:59:59PM March 19, 2008 
_

**SAN FRANCISCO – (March 19, 2008**) – Solidus Networks, Inc., dba Pay By Touch, regretfully announced today that 
it will no longer process biometric transactions on behalf of its merchant 
customers and consumer membership base, as of 11:59:59PM March 19, 2008. 

On December 14, 2007, Solidus Networks filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection 
under Chapter 11. As part of the company’s restructuring, it was determined 
that the enterprise could no longer support the biometric authentication and 
payment system as it currently exists, based on lack of funding and current 
market conditions. 

Other non-biometric Solidus Networks business units will continue on their 
current business paths. 

Solidus Networks extends its sincere gratitude to the shoppers, merchants, 
vendors, investors, partners, and employees who have been supporting the company’s 
vision since its first biometric payment transaction in 2002.

bummer about PBT going down the tubes. Maybe you need a fave icon to cheer you up!
