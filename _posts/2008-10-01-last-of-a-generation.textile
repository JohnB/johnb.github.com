			<p>My aunt Barbara passed away yesterday. We were never close, but she was the last of her siblings to pass on, even though she was the oldest. I know that was hard on her. Now its finally her turn. May she find rest.</p>
<p>She played a pivotal role in my life, long before I was even conceived. After her mother, my grandmother, had passed away, Barb took it upon herself to put my mother through college. I doubt she ever understood this nuclear engineering thing my mother studied, but she supported it. And eventually my mother met another engineer and here I am today.</p>
<p>It wasn’t unexpected – she had been declining for a while – but I’m surprised at how choked up I am about her passing. Outspoken, disapproving, warm and alive – often in the same sentence.</p>
<p>I remember a message she once left on our answering machine. Her voice sounded so similar to my dead mother’s voice, with the same Pennsylvania accent, that it sent chills up my spine.</p>
<p>Thanks Barb, for all you’ve done and all you were – you’ll be missed – and in the end, what more is there, than to be missed?</p>
