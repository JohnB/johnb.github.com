A few years back, we took a trip from the Bay Area all the way to British Colombia. 
Near the apex of our journey we saw the most incredible sights. Orca whales, 
swimming at and _under_ our boat. Brown-colored Black bears (yes, the distinction 
matters) by the side of the road. And on a mountain near Whistler – the place 
where I really learned to ski many years ago (such as a boy from San Diego 
_can_ actually learn to ski) – we saw a huge totem called an Anukshuk. Built 
of huge Stonehenge-style rocks, it was perched  far up the mountain. I liked 
it so much that I started using it as my avatar on a number of sites.

Anukshuk)

Yes, I know that it is one of the mascots of the 2010 Olympic games. I thought 
it would be so cool to make use it, long before the rest of the world associated 
it with anything other than me. But now, as the date (February 2010) approaches, 
I wonder when – or if – I should replace it. I’d like it to be a gradual process 
– but that is not usually the way these things work. You replace one image 
with another. Whoosh. Done.

And so I ponder. But as I ponder, the Games come closer. And with the date 
getting closer, it impacts The Locals more and more. To house and feed and 
transport that abrupt influx of humanity that is The Games, there must be changes. 
A streamlining of transport. A building of hotel rooms. A “regooding” of the 
now-deemed-blighted sections of the city. A streamlining of the food establishments, 
to cater to the oh-hey-theres-a-Starbucks-right-there crowd. Consistency is 
chosen, time and again, over flavorful melange.

But these Locals speak our language – by gosh they’re almost ‘mericans! Some, 
like the quirky observer William Gibson, [use a delicate turn of phrase to 
create new words for the process that is unfolding](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/archives/article761742.ece 
"William Gibson defines "regood""). Others, like Tim Bray of the Urban Geek 
persuasion (no, I don’t know what that phrase means either) [point us toward](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/05/31/Gone-World 
"just follow the damn link")[ articles detailing the decline of the locals](http://thetyee.ca/News/2007/05/30/RAVCambie/) 
under an onslaught of progress and, later, of the [fights and Pyrrhic victories](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/05/27/Justice). 
How soon until we see articles about the replacement of family owned businesses 
with multinational conglomerates? And do I want to be associated with all that 
through my avatar?

Stay tuned!
