title: On Second Thought, the Avatar Will Stay
---
# {{ page.title }}
<p>I’ve now reconsidered <a href="http://johnb.github.io/2009/05/28/the-avatar-must-die"event_item">my earlier plan</a> to get rid of my avatar. Why? I’m so glad you asked. Three reasons:</p>
<p>I’m now identified with the avatar. I recently contacted <a title="Chris, AKA defunkt" href="http://github.com/defunkt">a guy</a> that I hadn’t corresponded with in a while and he said “Oh yeah – I remember you. The guy with the big rock man thing”. So if I get rid of the avatar, I might lose some of the people that would otherwise “recognize” me online.</p>
<p>The Games will blow over but the avatar is still, in my opinion, pretty darn cool. Ya don’t see huge multi-ton monoliths every day.</p>
<p>Time and inertia. I have very little “spare” time in my life and my plan for changing the avatar would likely have taken some time to get right (a series of ~10 images shifting from the rock man to my own smiling face). This is time that would take away from whatever projects I’d otherwise be working on.</p>
<p>So, I hope you like it – you’ll keep seeing it on <a href="http://twitter.com/JohnB">twitter</a> and other places.</p>
