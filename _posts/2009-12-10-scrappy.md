<p><em>Update: Ignore all the great ideas below. @defunkt pointed me to <a href="http://github.com/edspencer/jaml/">jaml</a>, which does a big chunk of what I was interested in.</em></p>
<p>I’ve followed the work of <a href="http://twitter.com/hcatlin">@hcatlin</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/defunkt">@defunkt</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/justinbmeyer">@justinbmeyer</a> on templating languages (<a href="http://haml-lang.com/">haml</a>, <a href="http://javascriptmvc.com/">mustache</a> and <a href="http://javascriptmvc.com/">javascriptMVC</a>) and have looked for something that met my needs. Here is an idea that seems simpler than javascriptMVC but has more power than haml or mustache – hopefully the sweet spot I’ve been looking for.</p>
<p>The initial idea, inspired by haml but not needing a text parser, was to represent markup as JSON:</p>
<p><script src="http://gist.github.com/253446.js?file=simple_markup.js"></script> Which would generate: <script src="http://gist.github.com/253468.js?file=simple_markup.html"></script></p>
<p>However, this provides no support for interaction with the markup. When considering generating a set of dialogs for user interaction I really wanted field validation built in, like this:</p>
<p><script src="http://gist.github.com/253511.js?file=markup_with_validation.js"></script> Eventually I realized that wrapping all the functionality as a filter, in essence creating a tiny <em>scrap</em> of functionality, was what I was looking for:  <script src="http://gist.github.com/253551.js?file=scrap_for_user_form.js"></script></p>
<p>I could see wrapping a form scrap in a larger dialog-handling scrap that knew enough to validate its internal scraps before allowing the OK button to save the data. It should work – I just wish it could be as pretty as the others – but I don’t see that as possible, given the semantics of JSON.</p>
<p>The true test will be when I actually implement the code to support such a construct. Look for a <em>johnb/scrappy</em> project on Github. Until then, I’ll just assume it works! <img src="http://johnb.github.io/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley"></p>
