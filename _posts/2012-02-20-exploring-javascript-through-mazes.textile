title: Exploring Javascript through Mazes
---

h1. {{ page.title }}

Inspired by Jack Danger Canty's exhortation to rewrite his
<a href="https://github.com/JackDanger/maze/blob/master/maze.rb">depth-first maze</a>
in another language, I chose pure javascript. JQuery provides all sorts of goodness, as
does Backbone and Ember, but I wanted to practice using the browser's assembly language - javascript -
to implement my maze. My implementation can be found here:
<a href="http://johnb.github.com/maze.html">just use 'view source' to see the entire implementation.</a>

The only thing I added over his implementation was the delayed redraw of each cell, allowing us to see
the maze being developed. I also, inadvertently, added a bass-ackwards grid that needs to be accessed
as Y,X instead of the usual X,Y (oops).

Try it yourself in yet another language - its kinda fun.
