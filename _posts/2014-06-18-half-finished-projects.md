# My Life In Repos(e)

I realize that I often downplay my
[github repos](https://github.com/JohnB?tab=repositories) by
describing them as "toys" or "crap" and that I am selling myself short.
They are more like semi-public learning opportunities. I learn a lot from
each of them, even if I don't
tweet about each success or failure
or write a blog post about it.

- [callback](https://github.com/JohnB/callback), a simple persistent proxy.
It allowed me to learn that [meteor](http://meteor.com) does not work the
same way Rails does (which is obvious in hindsight, but I didn't think of in
the few minutes it took to put the app together). I think that client-side
rendering in meteor (coming soon?) will allow me to solve the problem.
- [follow the leader](https://github.com/JohnB/follow-the-leader), a
[Glympse](https://www.glympse.com/)-like app with location technology that will
soon be provided by default in iOS8.
- [minesweeper](https://github.com/JohnB/minesweeper) could be fun to write and
make into a multiplayer game.
- [geolocation](https://github.com/JohnB/geolocation) and
[geotest](https://github.com/JohnB/geotest) which were an attempt to extract
and demo the location-tracking code from [follow the leader](https://github.com/JohnB/follow-the-leader).

- I have the [start of a meteor version](https://github.com/JohnB/meteor-poker-calculator)
of my older [poker calculator](http://johnb.github.io/poker.html) (which is
more up-to-date than the [github repo of the same name](https://github.com/JohnB/poker_calculator))
- And my [maze game](http://johnb.github.com/maze.html) was fun to write (and [write about](https://johnb.github.io/2012/02/20/exploring-javascript-through-mazes.html) )
but needs a bit of an update. I look back at it and it seems that my porting of 
[original code](https://github.com/JackDanger/maze/blob/master/maze.rb) to javascript was 
a bit too literal - there are some improvements I can make. If they work, maybe I'll backport the fix to ruby and do a pull request.
