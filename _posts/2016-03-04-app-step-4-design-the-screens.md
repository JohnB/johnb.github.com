# App Step 4 Design the Screens
I use [my mobile-first poker app](http://johnb.github.io/poker.html) once a month to divvy up the proceeds at my poker night. And once a month I'm annoyed at some missing features in my earlier app:

* no history of games
* no mapping from username to their email address (I manually find the addresses each week - sometimes sending to their work address (people get prickly about it for good reason - I gotta fix it)
* a clunky UX flow that forces the user to do all the work at the end of the night when people are waiting to go home.
* no assistance in *organizing* the night by sneding invites or collecting responses.

So my goal is not just to test out these new technologies, meteor and react, but to improve on the UX as well. Hence, I plan to build these screens:

- [ ] add another player (with "send them an invite?" checkbox)
- [ ] suggest a night for a game (text area for wordage) 
- [ ] start the night - buy-in? who is here? chips per person? along with an "add player" button
- [ ] end the night
  - [ ] stimulus given? stimulus subtracted out?
  - [ ] chips per player
  - [ ] simple chip adder modal (+10/20/3/040/50/5/1/.5/.25 or -1 or clear
  - [ ] table of results
  - [ ] who is keeping the chips?
  - [ ] send email (add some wordage
- [ ] "current game" page (next or previous or ongoing)

Tomorrow: the Add Player screen.
