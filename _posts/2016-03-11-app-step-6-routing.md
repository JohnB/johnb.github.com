# App Step 6 Routing
For those paying attention (which, apparently, does not include me) the project at this point has not one, but *two* routers - both the iron-router added when I created the app and the react router that I pulled over from the todo app.

I need to remove one of them (I don't care which one) and then make the routing work so I can transtion from one screen to another. Ideally the transition will include some snazzy animation.
