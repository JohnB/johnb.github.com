# To Elixir from Phoenix

The last time I switched my paid development work,
from C++ to Ruby and Rails,
I came at it from using Ruby scripting then later to Rails.
So I had a good foundation in the language before diving
into the "magic" of Rails.

With Phoenix and Elixir, which may be my next development stack,
I'm intentionally coming at it from Phoenix-is-kinda-Railish
perspective. The MVC patterns of Rails have similarities - like
a foreign language that kinda makes sense because you speak a
related language. Where Ruby chains methods together with dots,
Elixir uses the pipe-greater-than symbol ("|>").

I have a vague understanding that
```
|> the things
|> between
|> pipes
```

are not just method calls,
that they are actually full-fledged Erlang processes - but it works
fine to just think of them as method calls instead of inter-process RPCs.
