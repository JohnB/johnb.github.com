# How to Start a new Job (WIP)

## People

TODO: get view-level credentials ASAP to the internal wiki of the bio blurbs.

Remember names by finding their bio on the wiki and screen-shotting

## Laptop

* use my latest [`.bashrc` file](http://johnb.github.io/dot_bashrc.txt).
* [clipmenu](http://www.clipmenu.com/)
* Change menubar clock to show `Day Mon Date Hour:Minute:Second`
* Install the editor that the team has decided upon and learn it in every pairing session.

## Code

* Look over recent issues and features, as found in the latest git commits  (`gitk` may be the best tool for it)
* Look at github issues (if any) and pull requests. Would you have OK'd those pull requests? 
Could some tool like `rubocop` have improved the code with less rancor?
* What was committed to `master` *without* going thru a pull request?
* Put a name to the author(s) of each commit. Get a sense of their style.

## Architecture

* Be Gentle. Every wart seemed like a good idea at the time.
* Look at performance issues and scalability problems as opportunities for elixir.

## Product

* Listen. Read. Ask intently.
* Ask again.
* Challenge.
* Commit.
