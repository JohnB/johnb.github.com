# Try the site. We guarantee nothing.

For a developer, it is a critical balance:
* We need your email address to reach you.
* But we might get hacked and leak your address.

* We need your location to be relevant in your neighborhood.
* But we might get hacked and divulge your location.

* We might try to anonymize your data.
* But its really hard to do it well.

* We might eventually get it right.

Trust us. Or not.
