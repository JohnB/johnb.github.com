# Visions

I have a vision for this site, for what it could become. But I won't share it yet.
Be patient. Interact with it. Each interaction is a piece of the puzzle of what will be.

The earliest experimenters, as always, will gain the most from their experience. 
Seeing and experiencing the site, through all its hiccups, will be worth it.

Remember the twitter fail whale? Remember the early days of facebook? of github?

You get a sense that, technically, you're just as good as their founders. You make mistakes.
They make mistakes. Unless its a catastrophically bad one, you look back with some fondness
for the early days, before they grew up and got a job.

Try the site. We guarantee nothing.
